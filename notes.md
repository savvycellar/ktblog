This entire website is dedicated to you.

I feel very lucky to be able to go to so many fun places with you, many of which I would not have gone to without you.

During the process of creating this website, I had to go through all the pictures, check the dates we travelled,  look up the names of the places we've been to, and read the history of some of the places. It was like reliving those journeys again. We took thousands of pictures, and I chose the ones that invoked happy memories for me as I went through the pictures. There are many good pictures of us, none of them are posted, as I wanted to protect our privacy, mainly yours.  

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making it happen, for all your hard work in researching, planning, travel booking. I feel very grateful, humble and thank my lucky stars to have you as my travel mate.
