7 day roadtrip in New Mexico. 

We stayed at Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Majestic views of Rio Grande, Cottonwood trees with its radiant shades of yellows. We visited Taos, White Sands National Park and [Ghost Ranch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Ranch).

So little traffic, I was not aware I was speeding. The nice highway patrol cop let me go with a smile.

So little crowd, except when 12 people were standing shoulder to shoulder in the basket of our hot air balloon.
