May 10 - 21. We stayed at Sibonne Beach Hotel in [Turks and Caicos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands). Took a short plane ride to Grand Turk Island and stayed there for 6 nights. There were many wild donkeys roaming everywhere on Grand Turk. Flamingos were a common sight in town. We also took a ferry to visit Middle and North Caicos.

Very blue seas. Though honestly, the weather was a bit too hot for me.
