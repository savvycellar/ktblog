Jul 9 - 20. Our second summer roadtrip this summer. This time we traveled to Trinity County, Humboldt County, Shasta County and Plumas County. 

First stop was 2 nights at Trinity Outpost, a very cool private campground in a very remote forest in Trinity County, owned by a nice couple. 

We then stayed 2 nights at View Crest Lodge, then camped again for 3 nights in Jedediah Smith State Park which had nice huge clean shower rooms. And we saw wild elks.

Next stop was an airbnb in Mount Shasta for 3 nights. We were supposed to stay for 2 more nights at a yurt at Quincy, Plumas County, but we went home instead because it was too hot to sleep in the yurt.
