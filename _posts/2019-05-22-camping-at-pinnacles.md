May 22 - 27. Camped for 3 nights at Pinnacles National Park followed by a 2 night stay in a bed & breakfast in Pacific Grove.

When you suggested going camping, I felt a bit apprehensive as I remember not being able to sleep the last time I camped 20 years ago as I was so cold.

Thank you for showing me the right way to camp. I sleep as well or even better while camping than sleeping at home now.
