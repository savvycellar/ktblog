Dec 18, 2019 - Jan 11, 2020. Our first multi-week trip together. 3.5 weeks in Germany. I felt like a little girl in a candy store. Every day there was like living in a fairy tale world.

We stayed at Berlin, Lubeck and Wernigerode and visited many small towns in between. 

I loved the Christmas markets, eating cakes and drinking coffees, and just admiring the fairytale like buildings. I didn't even mind the cold so much, although Berlin is cold.
