May 10 - 12. Our first overnight trip together. Karaoke and roller skating in the funky Church of 8 Wheels in San Francisco.

We walked around Little Italy and walked into a restaurant during a quiet afternoon and asked for Zabaglione. The nice restaurant owner said it's not on the menu but said he will have the chef make it for us. It has become Our Dessert ever since.

You had a special surprise for me and told me to dress warm. It was for a boat trip to Farallon Islands. I remember seeing huge whales and lots of seals and birds, although to be honest, my memory is fuzzy as I was seasick most of the time. I will always pack Dramamine on all our future trips.
