Nov 2 - 23. 3 week trip to Big Island. We visited right after Hawaii was open to tourists again since covid started.

We stayed at 3 different places, Kailua-Kona, Volcano and Puako, drove around the whole island in our rental car.

Probably one of my favorite travel destinations. Hiked a lot, snorkeled a lot, went on a night snorkeling tour to see Manta Rays, they were huge. 

Very memorable experience crossing a river at Waipi'o Valley. We saw wild horses there. 

Hilo with it's fresh produce market is a fun town to visit, we loved Two Ladies Kitchen's mochi.

Walked through the middle of the crater of Kilauea Iki in Volcano National Park. Steam was still coming out of the ground.

We had Kaumana Caves all to ourselves. It's so dark inside I could not see my own hands and felt that we had to whisper to each other even though there's no one else. A bit spooky.
