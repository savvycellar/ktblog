Sep 21 - 27.

We spent 3 nights camping at Hendy Wood State Park and 2 nights at a cute bed & breakfast in Arcata.

Sparkling wine tasting at [Scharffenberger Cellars](https://scharffenbergercellars.com/visit) was fun, so was cider tasting at [Gowan's](https://www.gowansheirloomcider.com/book-online) Orchard & Cidery.
