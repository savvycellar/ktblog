Sep 21 - Oct 6. Spain.

A fun 16 day adventure in Southern Spain. We flew to Madrid, and stayed at Toledo, Cordoba, Seville, Ronda, Granada, Madrid.

Stopped by Arcos de la Frontera, Jerez de la Frontera, Marbella, Malaga.

Weather was perfect. Amazing food. So much history and majestic sights. 

I am a lucky woman.
