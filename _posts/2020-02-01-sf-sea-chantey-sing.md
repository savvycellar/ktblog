Feb 1 - 2. We didn't know covid would change the world in just a few weeks.

A relaxing one night getaway in San Francisco. We had a fun time at a public [chantey sing along](https://www.nps.gov/safr/learn/historyculture/chantey-sing.htm).

Hiked up Coit Tower, went to the Ferry Building, nice dinner at Mourad, followed up by a sundae at Ghirardelli Square where a big owl flew over us.
