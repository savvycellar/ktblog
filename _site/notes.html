<p>This entire website is dedicated to you.</p>

<p>I feel very lucky to be able to go to so many fun places with you, many of which I would not have gone to without you.</p>

<p>During the process of creating this website, I had to go through all the pictures, check the dates we travelled,  look up the names of the places weâ€™ve been to, and read the history of some of the places. It was like reliving those journeys again. We took thousands of pictures, and I chose the ones that invoked happy memories for me as I went through the pictures. There are many good pictures of us, none of them are posted, as I wanted to protect our privacy, mainly yours.</p>

<p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making it happen, for all your hard work in researching, planning, travel booking. I feel very grateful, humbled and thank my lucky stars to have you as my travel mate.</p>
