  <h1>SF and Farallon Islands</h1>

  <p>May 10 - 12. Our first overnight trip together. Karaoke and roller skating in the funky Church of 8 Wheels in San Francisco.</p>

<p>We walked around Little Italy and walked into a restaurant during a quiet afternoon and asked for Zabaglione. The nice restaurant owner said itâ€™s not on the menu but said he will have the chef make it for us. It has become Our Dessert ever since.</p>

<p>You had a special surprise for me and told me to dress warm. It was for a boat trip to Farallon Islands. I remember seeing huge whales and lots of seals and birds, although to be honest, my memory is fuzzy as I was seasick most of the time. I will always pack Dramamine on all our future trips.</p>

<em>I have fond memories of eating that Zabaglione with you</em></p>

<em>Last picture I took before I got seasick, which is only 10 minutes into the boat ride</em></p>
