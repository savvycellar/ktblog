  <h1>Big Island Trip</h1>

  <p>Nov 2 - 23. 3 week trip to Big Island. We visited right after Hawaii was open to tourists again since covid started.</p>

<p>We stayed at 3 different places, Kailua-Kona, Volcano and Puako, drove around the whole island in our rental car.</p>

<p>Probably one of my favorite travel destinations. Hiked a lot, snorkeled a lot, went on a night snorkeling tour to see Manta Rays, they were huge.</p>

<p>Very memorable experience crossing a river at Waipi’o Valley. We saw wild horses there.</p>

<p>Hilo with it’s fresh produce market is a fun town to visit, we loved Two Ladies Kitchen’s mochi.</p>

<p>Walked through the middle of the crater of Kilauea Iki in Volcano National Park. Steam was still coming out of the ground.</p>

<p>We had Kaumana Caves all to ourselves. It’s so dark inside I could not see my own hands and felt that we had to whisper to each other even though there’s no one else. A bit spooky.</p>
