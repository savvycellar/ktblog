  <h1>Turks and Caicos</h1>

  <p>May 10 - 21. We stayed at Sibonne Beach Hotel in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands">Turks and Caicos</a>. Took a short plane ride to Grand Turk Island and stayed there for 6 nights. There were many wild donkeys roaming everywhere on Grand Turk. Flamingos were a common sight in town. We also took a ferry to visit Middle and North Caicos.</p>

<p>Very blue seas. Though honestly, the weather was a bit too hot for me.</p>
